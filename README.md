# BabysitterKata

This kata simulates a babysitter working and getting paid for one night. The rules are pretty straight forward.

The babysitter:

    gets paid $10/hour from 5pm to 9pm
    gets paid $15/hour from 9pm to midnight
    gets paid $20/hour from midnight to 4am
    gets paid for quarter hours
